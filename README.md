<h2>Background</h2>
This battelship game is a build on python. 
The goal of this game is to hit all the computer ships before he hits yours.
The first one hitting all the ship of the other is the winner.

<h2>How to play</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Enter your name</li>
    <img style="width:300px" src="assets/images/name.webp"><br>
    <li>Let the software create two boards with ships on it</li>
    <img style="width:300px" src="assets/images/boards.webp"><br>
    <li>Guess where the computer ships are by entering a position : row and col.</li>
    <li>Let the computer do the same for your ships</li>
    <li>Let the software check if you and the computer hit or miss the enemy ships</li>
    <li>Let the software print you new boards and the new results with your scores</li>
    <img style="width:300px" src="assets/images/scores.webp"><br>
    <li>Enter if you still want to continue the game</li>
    <li>Repeat the guessing step until the game is over</li>
</ol>

For you information, the board are 3 on 3 with 2 ships to facilitate the testing of the game. The user ship position are marked with a S. Hits on the boards are notify by a X and miss by a O.

<ul>
    <li>Choice of the size of the board</li>
    <li>Choice of number and size of the ships on the board</li>
    <li>Entering the position of the computer ship with number form 1 to ... instead fo the 0 to...</li>
    <li>Possiblity to play online against other humain player</li>
    <li>Management the ex aequo case</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data model</h2>

I choose to follow the same pattern of the code institue battelship game.

I buil a Board class with all function inside and I activated them in the main function making the game come alive.

Two board (instances) are build out of the board class to allow the game to happen.

<h2>Testing</h2>

<ul>
    <li>I tested the game (and the error scenarios) on VSC and Heroku, no problem found</li>
    <li>I tested the game on PEP8, no problem found</li>
    <li>My 8 years of boy tested, his comment "Cool Dady"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<h3>Solved bug</h3>

<ul>
    <li>I regularly forgot to put ":" after defining my function.</li>
    <li>I tried first to update the target position from the user and the computer inside the class, but I was putting the user and the computer guess in the same list and creating confusion between you targeted what position</li>
    <li>I did put "," between the argument of my functions creating bugs </li>
    <li>I first didn't define my score var in the main as global creating a scope issue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Existing bug : None</h3>

<h2>Deployement</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Fork or clone this repository</li>
    <li>Create a new Heroku app</li>
    <li>Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in this order</li>
    <li>Link the Heroku app to the repository</li>
    <li>Deploy</li>
</ol>
