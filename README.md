<h2>Background</h2>
This Battleship game is built in Python. The objective is to sink all of the computer's ships before it sinks yours. The player who sinks all the opponent's ships first is the winner.

<h2>How to play</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Please enter your name.</li>
    <img style="width:300px" src="assets/images/name.webp"><br>
    <li>Have the program generate two boards, each with ships placed on them.</li>
    <img style="width:300px" src="assets/images/boards.webp"><br>
    <li>Try to guess the location of the computer's ships by entering a position: row and column.</li>
    <img style="width:300px" src="assets/images/guess.webp"><br>
    <li>Let the computer attempt to guess the locations of your ships as well.</li>
    <li>Let the program verify if you or the computer hit or missed the enemy's ships.</li>
    <li>Have the program display the updated boards and show the current scores after each round.</li>
    <img style="width:300px" src="assets/images/scores1.webp"><br>
    <img style="width:300px" src="assets/images/scores2.webp"><br>
    <li>Continue repeating the guessing step until all ships are sunk and the game is over.</li>
</ol>

For your information, the boards are 5x5 in size, each with 4 ships. The user's ship positions are marked with an 'S'. Hits on the boards are indicated by an 'X', and misses are marked with an 'O'.

    <li>Option to select the number and size of ships on the board</li>
    <li>Allow input for ship positions using numbers starting from 1 instead of 0</li>
    <li>Ability to play online against other human players</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Model</h2>

I chose to follow the structure of the Code Institute Battleship game.

I built a `Board` class with all the necessary functions, and I activated them in the main function to make the game work.

Two boards (instances) are created from the `Board` class, allowing the game to take place.

<h2>Testing</h2>

<ul>
    <li>I tested the game (and various error scenarios) in Visual Studio Code and on Heroku; no issues were found.</li>
    <li>I tested the game using PEP8, finding no critical issues. However, there were around 100 spacing issues, all of which were fixed.</li>
    <li>My 8-year-old son tested the game, and his feedback was, "Cool, Daddy!"</li>
    <li>For testing purposes, I reduced the board size to 2x2 and limited the number of ships to 1, to verify the result displays.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solved Bugs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I often forgot to put ":" after defining functions.</li>
    <li>Initially, I updated the target positions for both the user and the computer in the same list, causing confusion about who targeted which position.</li>
    <li>I mistakenly added commas between the arguments of my functions, which caused bugs.</li>
    <li>Initially, I didn't define the `score` variable as global in the main function, causing a scope issue.</li>
    <li>PEP8 flagged some necessary and unnecessary spacing issues, all of which were resolved.</li>
    <li>While asking for the playerâ€™s name, the input wasn't being correctly validated, which I fixed based on my mentor's advice.</li>
    <li>I had to add a message in case of a tie (ex aequo).</li>
    <li>To improve usability, I added the option to answer "Y" as well as "y" to the prompt asking if the player wants to continue playing.</li>
    <li>The computer's guesses were being recorded in the user's guess variable, which I corrected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Existing Bugs: None</h3>
